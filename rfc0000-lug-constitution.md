## <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction



## <a name="NAO"></a> Name and Objective

### <a name="Organization-Name"></a> Organization Name

This organization shall be know as the Linux User's Group or "LUG" for short. Throughout this document the organization will be referred to by its acronym, LUG.

### <a name="Objective"></a> Objective

The objective of this organization is to promote the understanding of and participation in the open source software community.

## <a name="Membership"></a> Membership

### <a name="Elligibility"></a> Eligibility

Membership is open to any student, faculty, staff, or alumni of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and shall be free of discrimination based on gender, race, religion, physical disability, or sexual orientation.

### <a name="Standing"></a> Standing

A member in the organization can it good or poor standing. By default members are in good standing upon joining the organization. A member in good standing has all the rights and privileges granted to that member by this document. To remain in good standning a member must:

- Contirbute to meetings and activities
- Uphold and complete all duties and responsibilities assigned them as members

Penalties for members in poor standing shall be drafted and maintained by the [Executive Committee](#Executive-Committee).

### <a name="Tiers"></a> Tiers

There are two membership tiers: university and alumni.

#### University

University tier membership is open to any current student, faculty, or staff of UIC.

#### Alumni

Alumni tier membership is open to any former student, faculty, or staff of UIC. 

### Dues

The Executive Committee shall have the right to levy fair annual dues for membership. All university tier members must pay these dues or risk falling into poor standing or potential expulsion from the organization at the descresion of the Executive Committee. Alumni members shall be exempt from any dues.

### Expulsion

A member may be expelled from the LUG for any or all of the following reasons:

- Stealing or abuse of finds
- Physical or verbal abuse of members
- Any gross misconduct as so deemed by the Executive Committee

In order for a member to be expelled a majority vote must be obtained from all university tier members. This vote will be held over the course of seven days to give members ample time to consider their decision and vote. At the end of the voting period votes will be tallied and the necessary action will be taken.

## <a name="Executive-Committee"></a> Executive Committee

The Executive Committee shall be the primary governing body of the LUG. It will conduct, on behalf of the LUG, all buisness it deems necessary and consist of three sets: Traditional Officers, Non-Traditional Officers, and The Vox.

### <a name="Voting-and-Quorum"></a> Voting and Quorum

All voting matters shall be decided by a majority vote of a quorum of at least 2/3 of the university tier members, one of whom must not be a traditional officer (so long as such a member exists), with the exception of any process which this document describes should be decided by some other process.

### Offices and Officers

Officer positions in the LUG may be created and destroyed at the will of the executive committee by a standard vote as described in the [Voting and Quorum](#Voting-and-Quorum) section with exception to the three UIC required postiions as described in the section [Traditional Officers](#Traditional-Officers). 

All officers shall have a term of one calender year starting on the day elected.

No officer, traditional or otherwise, has any more decision making power than any other member. The purpose of officers in the LUG is to keep things organized, documented, and to help ensure that the LUG stays on track of its goals as decided by the executive committee. They do not hold power akin to leaders in other organizations unless granted that power by the executive committee. Because of this power structure there is no term limit on any office in the organization.

### <a name="Traditional-Officers"></a> Traditional Officers

There shall be three offices which must be filled each calendar year by university tier members of the LUG. These positions are required by the university and so therefore must be filled. These positions are President, Vice-President, and Treasurer. Each position may be filled by one person and one person only. This person must not have any other traditional officer position.

#### President

The president's duties are as follows:

- Ensure that the organization upholds the principals laid down in this document and in any further governing document created by the executive committee.
- To be an easy point of contact for people inside and outside the organization on matters related to the organization.
- Monitor and track prgress of goals set for the LUG by the Executive Committee.

#### Vice-President

The Vice-President shares the same duties as the President and it should be decided shortly after election how best to divide those duties between the two officers.

#### Treasurer  

The Treasurer's duties are as follows:

- Ensure the creation of a budget by the Executive Committee, shortly after elections, for the next year.
- Monitor the budget of the organization and assure it is spent appropriately.
- Keep track of all money coming into and leaving the organization

### <a name="Non-Traditional-Officers"></a> Non-Traditional Officers

Any university tier member or User Group may be appointed by the Executive Committee as a non-traditonal officer in order to oversee or administer some important process for the LUG. 

### <a name="The-Vox"></a> The Vox

The Vox consists of all non-officer university tier members of the LUG. Each member of the LUG has the same say in decision making as anyone else and to further that point this document explicitly creates The Vox as a part of the Executive Committee. This freedom and power also means members have a high responsibility to participate to the fullest amount they can in the goings on of the LUG.

## <a name="Laws"></a> Executive Committee Decisions

Any proposal brought to, or decision made by the Executive Committee should be drafted in the form a a document called a Request For Comments, or RFC for short, as a nod to the IETF RFC standards approval process.

RFCs should be relitivly short well thought out descriptions of some policy, rule, or regulation proposed to the Executive Committee. This system exist to ensure there is a well documented history of Executive Committee decisions for reference on future actions.

All approved RFCs must be kept somewhere publically accessible to all members of the LUG.

Any RFC which modifies, even temporarily, a policy that exists in another RFC must contain a reference to that RFC so that one can easily cross reference RFCs. The modified RFC must then be annotated with a reference to this change and the new RFC. Any RFC found by the Executive Committee to violate this rule is immediately invalidated until the RFC is corrected and revoted on.

The Executive Committee shall hold a standard vote to decide on all proposed RFCs.

This document may be used as a stylistic guide for the fromat of RFCs. All RFCs should be given a unique identifying number incrementing from zero.

## <a name="User-Groups"></a> User Groups

User groups are sub-units of the LUG devoted to some buisness of interest to one or more members of the LUG. User groups can be created for any purpose whether it be a general discussion group, a group in charge of admistering some buisness of the LUG, or anything else the members desire. Groups exist to have a framework for members of the LUG to self-organize and participate in and enrich the LUG community.

No member in good standing may be excluded from a group that that individual wishes to join.

There are two tiers of LUG user group: unofficial and official.

### Unofficial Groups

Unofficial User Groups may be formed by any member(s) in good standing of the LUG at any time. Those wishing to create the group should gather together and write a document defining what the group is, what it will do, and how it will be run. This document should be iteratively improved over time with the eventual goal of it becoming the official proposal for this unofficial group to become an official group.

Unofficial groups may be granted funds by the Executive Committee upon request but are not guarunteed an annual budget.

### Official Groups

Official User Groups are official sub-groups of the LUG. Any university tier member in good standing may submit a proposal to the Executive Committee to create an Official User Group. This proposal should come in the form of an official RFC and describe what the group is, what it will do, and how it will be run. If this group was formerly an Unofficial User Group this document should already be existent.

Official User Groups are to be allotted an annual budget by the Executive Committee.

Official User Groups are expected to keep careful record of their finances, membership, and activities. Representatives of each group will prepare a report of the status of the group, which should include the information kept in the required group records described above, each year to the executive committee.

## <a name="Meetings"></a> Meetings

There are two meetings that the LUG most hold each year. These meetings must happen in the spring semester and should occur within one year of the previous meeting. The root user group shall be responsible for scheduling and running these meetings.

- Election Meeting
- Budget Meeting

## <a name="Advisor"></a> Advisor

The LUG shall enlist the assistance of an adviser on all projects. The LUG adviser shall be a full-time faculty member at UIC.

## <a name="Amendments-and-Revisions"></a> Amendments and Revisions

This document may be altered by a vote of the Executive Committee. To pass any alteration a 2/3 majority vote must be taken of 3/4 of the total university tier members of the LUG who are in good standing.
